<h1 align="center">NBA players breakout-year prediction</h1>


  <p align="center">
    Each year in the NBA, some players have a "breakout season", where they improve the level of their game significantly, which is usually expressed in their statistics. Can breakout seasons be predicted before the season starts? This is the aim of this project.

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This project started from an enthusiastic, yet frustrated fantasy-basketball player, who also happens to be a data scientist.
In the project I use machine learning models in order to predict breakout seasons. The data comes from the python NBA API.
Have fun!

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

Here, you can find the notebook containing the code.
In addition, there are 2 csv files:
* nba_playes_data.csv - The data used for this project after some parsing.
* clean_ready_nba_players_data.csv - The data after all the cleaning and manipulations. Ready for the modeling part.
